## Media Player (Windows 11)
Media Player (Windows 11) currently has an issue that prevents ZuseMe from detecting the currently playing song when using the next button, if you have the Windows feedback app installed you can help me make Microsoft aware of this issue so they can fix it by voting on the issue here: https://aka.ms/AAhb3hc

## Application description
